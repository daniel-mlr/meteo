# Weather App
As a second assignment for FreeCodeCamp Front End Developer Certification, we have to design an app that queries current user location and give basic weather information from the nearest meteo station, displaying appropriate icons. It was also required to allow the user to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units. This app uses the Open Weather API.
